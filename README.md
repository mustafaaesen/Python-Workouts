# 🐍 Python Workouts

A collection of **fundamental and intermediate Python exercises** that cover essential programming concepts, data structures, and practical code patterns.  
Each script focuses on a specific Python topic — from object-oriented programming to decorators, file handling, and generators.

---

## 📘 Overview

This repository serves as a **structured archive of Python examples**, written to demonstrate clean, readable, and maintainable code practices.  
It includes topics such as:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Classes, inheritance, encapsulation  
- **Functions & Decorators:** Custom decorators, recursion, built-in functions  
- **File Operations:** Reading, writing, and updating files  
- **Iterators & Generators:** Memory-efficient looping and custom iteration  
- **Modules:** Importing and organizing reusable code snippets
